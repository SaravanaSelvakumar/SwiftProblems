# SwiftProblems

A collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems implemented in Swift.
This repository contains solutions to small problem statements, along with clear explanations and methods for learning and practicing problem-solving skills in Swift.

📌 Features

🚀 Beginner-friendly problems in Swift.

🧩 Covers basic to intermediate DSA topics (arrays, strings, recursion, sorting, searching, etc.).

📖 Each file contains problem statement + solution.

🛠 Different approaches and methods are provided where possible.

⚡ Example

Problem: Reverse a number

func reverseNumber(_ num: Int) -> Int {
    var number = num
    var reversed = 0
    while number != 0 {
        let digit = number % 10
        reversed = reversed * 10 + digit
        number /= 10
    }
    return reversed
}

print(reverseNumber(-96734)) // Output: -43769
